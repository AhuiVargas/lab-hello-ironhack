# React | React Landing Page

## Introduction

We just learned the basics about creating a **Hello World** app in React, so we will use this exercise to re-do what we
just learned (and hopefully to add some style :blossom: ).

## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "your doubts"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

## Instructions

### Iteration 1 - Create the App

Let's start with the basics: as you can see `public` folder is already there and it has some images in it. Let's add the
folders you will need for the project: **`dist`** and **`src`**. Also, remember to create an **`index.html`** file,
where you will have the entry point of the application.

**(Refer to the lesson to see where `index.html` suppose to be.)**

#### Babel and Webpack

Our project needs to have two important packages that are necessary for compiling: `Babel` and `Webpack`.

But don't worry, we took care of it. As well as of `webpack.config.js` file. :heavy_check_mark:

### Iteration 2 - React Creation

You are ready to start creating your React app. First, add the packages you need (**react & react-dom**). And then
create an **`index.js`** file.

**(Refer to the lesson to see where this file suppose to be).**

## Iteration 3 - First Landing Page

Finally, let's create our landing page. In the `public` folder, you will find all the assets you need to recreate the
following landing page:

For now, don't worry about creating more than one component, we will cover that in the following lessons!

Happy coding! :heart:
